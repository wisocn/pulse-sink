## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository hosts an example project designed to achieve a high-volume, low-latency analytics ingester while keeping things simple. The project sets up an API tied to PostgreSQL with PgAdmin for administration, migrates the database schema, and offers a JSON API (sink) to push JSON data to the ingester.

On my machine (M1 MacBook Pro), I achieved over 6k+ RPS throughput with a P99 latency of 8ms and a P(MAX) of 236ms:

**Note:** This project uses PostgreSQL, an OLTP database. For analytics in a production system, consider using OLAP databases like BigQuery or Snowflake.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using any utilities from this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17 or later**
- **Gradle**
- **Git**
- **Docker/Docker Compose**
- **Just**

### Installation

You can use `.nix` and `flake.nix` to provision all required tools (except Git and Docker), or install the prerequisites via your package manager of choice.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

The entry point for this project is the **Justfile**. To see all available tasks, execute the command:

### Available Recipes

- `setup`
- `build`
- `package`
- `migrate`
- `run`
- `teardown`
- `benchmark number`



###  Setup
To setup everything we need for API to run we can use a just command `just setup`.
This will:
1. Spin up Docker containers (PostgreSQL, PgAdmin).
2. Wait until PostgreSQL is available and accepting connections.
3. Run Liquibase migrations from the `database` subfolder.

### Building

To build the project we execute `just build` which will trigger `./gradlew clean build shadowJar` and execute build and jar
packaging.

### Running 

Once the project has been built you can run it using `just run` which will spin a new java process with API.

### Load benchmarking

Benchmarking is supported using the Apache Benchmark utility (`ab`). 
To benchmark the API, use: `just benchmark {{number}}`. 
For example: 
1. `just benchmark 100`
2. `just benchmark 1000`
3. `just benchmark 10000`
etc..
